# SP SquonK

I am a FlyFF private server developer that puts most of his energy in refactoring the code and the architecture.

My biggest works so far are my [Server Starter](https://github.com/SPSquonK/ServerStarter) and the fact that [I fused every server side executable for SFlyFF](https://www.xn--s-sfa.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DBWorldServer02.png).

Make sure to visit my [gist page](https://gist.github.com/SPSquonK/) as I tend to publish a lot of observation and snippet.
If you understand french, you can also visit my [devblog](https://www.s√†.fr) for which you need to basically have a Msc in both FlyFF and C++ to understand what I'm talking about.
