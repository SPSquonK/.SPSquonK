## PokÃ©mon

I play pokemon fangames, including the official series. I kind of got interested in the fan games because I kind of hate the current direction the official license is taking. I list most of my playthoughts [on my website ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§](https://squonk.fr/pokemon/), and post poorly written reviews on gist.

## FlyFF

I am a FlyFF private server developed in hiatus that used to put most of this energy into refactoring the code and the architecture.

Some of my works include :
- My [Server Starter ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§](https://github.com/SPSquonK/ServerStarter)
- [I fused every server side executable for SFlyFF](https://www.xn--s-sfa.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/DBWorldServer02.png)
- I've posted some snippets on my [gist page ğŸ‡¬ğŸ‡§](https://gist.github.com/SPSquonK/).
- I wrote a french [devblog ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·](https://www.sÃ .fr) about my adventures (warning: because my writing skills are bad, you need a MSc both in FlyFF and C++ to understand something)

## Triple Triad

[I developed a private server for the FFWTT ğŸ‡«ğŸ‡·](https://esthar.fr), a french online Triple Triad game. While my server has currently no player base, you can still play against the bots that are always online.
